# Life after Mudd

Small webapp that visualizes where Harvey Mudd's Class of 2020 will be
after graduation, using data from [this Google
Form](https://forms.gle/PqEHTjpBDGBXfH4W8).

To run, first obtain credentials from **@raxod502** and place them in
`.oauth-private-key.json`. Then ... well, actually, the code hasn't
been written yet.
